# go-ezproxy: Documentation

<!--
  This file is intended as a "header" to give some context to a reader
  browsing this path via the GitHub web UI.
-->

## Overview

The collection of content in this path is intended as a "deeper dive" into
material that is potentially too verbose to include directly in the main
README file. Where applicable, this documentation may be mirrored within the
project GoDoc files. The goal is to surface this information in a way that
library users find the most helpful.

## Project home

See [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/atc0005/go-ezproxy) for the latest
code, to file an issue or submit improvements for review and potential
inclusion into the project.
