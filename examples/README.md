## Examples

This is a stub page intended to list examples for the usage of the
`go-ezproxy` module. As of this writing it is a stub page only.

Because the `atc0005/brick` project is close to an initial launch (pre-v1.0),
work for this portion of the module is "on hold". After the release of
`atc0005/brick`, the plan is to return here and update this page to refer
directly to applications that reflect real-world usage of this module.

### `brick`

- coming "soon"

### `es`

- small CLI application to list (and optionally terminate) matching user
  sessions for a specified user account
- coming "soon"

### `ezproxy`

- coming "soon"
- a "mock" `ezproxy` binary for testing purposes, not in any way an attempt to
  replace the actual/official application
